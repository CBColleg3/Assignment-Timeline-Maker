- EditTask, make the document/description text input more practical for editing large descriptions, maybe make it expanding?
- Integrate useForm into the editTask modal, to not allow changes if none have been made, makes the user think they have changed values if it's always enabled
- Integrate the moving of tasks into the new context, should be easy, as there already is an moving function


---- future:


--- Save Progress/Caching
-- integrate not caching, but a strategy similar that saves changes


--- Export
-- test export functionality, and see if it exports properly
