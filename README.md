## Introduction

The Assignment Timeline Maker is an application that aims to improve the ability of professors to accommodate neurodivergent students more efficiently through a helpful tool. Our application has two facets to it. The timeline it generates and the resultant document, a modified version of the original document uploaded. This timeline has all options for the user, ranging from changing the entire format of the timeline to editing small parts of it, which are the tasks of the timeline. The document viewer has two options for the user to select. One is the original document the other is the simplified document. Having tons of options and lots of flexibility for the user's preferences, we hope this application meets all your expectations!

## Details

### Header

> This is the application header. It has links to the authors and the link to our repository, and also the name of the application.

### Start & End Date

> The start and end date selector. Click on the start and end dates to change the time period of your assignment timeline.

### File Uploader

> Drag and drop a Microsoft Word (.docx) file into the area, or manually upload an image by clicking on the **Choose a file** text.

### File Display

> Uploaded documents are shown here. Click on a document to create a timeline. Your selected document will be highlighted blue in the file display, and have a checkmark on the far right. You can remove a document by clicking on its eraser icon.

### Timeline

> Once a document is selected, a timeline will be generated on the left side of your screen. At the very top, a table of contents will appear to give you a summary of your tasks for that document.

> The timeline itself is split into small tasks. Each day will be given a group of tasks to do, and tasks done in the same day are colored the same. You can drag and drop task cards along the timeline to reorganize them.

> Tasks can be edited by clicking on them, which shows the task editor menu. You can change a task's name, description, point value, and due date.

### Document Viewer

> Once a document is selected, it will appear on the right side of your screen. You can toggle to show the original text or a simplified version (CURRENT NON-FUNCTIONAL). Tasks for a specific day will be highlighted that day's color on the document viewer. In this example, Task 1 is green on the timeline, and is highlighted green on the document viewer text as well.
